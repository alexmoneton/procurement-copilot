Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something I've been working on that might interest you or your network.

I just launched TenderPulse - a platform that monitors European government procurement opportunities and sends daily alerts for contracts that match your business.

We're currently tracking 139+ active opportunities across 10 EU countries, with contract values ranging from €100K to €1M+.

The platform is completely self-service - no demos or sales calls needed. Users can sign up, create filters, and start receiving alerts in under 5 minutes.

Check it out: https://tenderpulse.eu

Would love your feedback, and if you know anyone who bids on government contracts, I'd appreciate an introduction!

Best,
Alexandre
