Hi [Name],

Quick question: How do you currently track European government procurement opportunities?

Most businesses miss 80% of relevant contracts because they're scattered across different portals.

TenderPulse solves this - we monitor 139+ active EU opportunities and send you daily alerts for contracts that match your business.

Current examples:
• €369K digital transformation - Madrid (deadline Oct 18)
• €790K government tech project - London (deadline Oct 17)  
• €624K infrastructure - Amsterdam (deadline Oct 15)

Takes 2 minutes to set up your first alert.
