## 🏢 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **1. Client Profile Setup**
Clients create a detailed profile including:

- **Preferred Countries**: Which EU countries they want to work in
- **CPV Expertise**: Common Procurement Vocabulary codes they specialize in

### **2. Smart Matching Algorithm**
The system calculates a **Smart Score (0-100%)** based on:

**🎯 Value Match (25 points):**
- Sweet spot scoring based on their target range
- Penalizes contracts too small or too large

**🌍 Geographic Preference (15 points):**
- Bonus for preferred countries
- Considers country difficulty levels

**🏷️ CPV Match (20 points):**
- Matches their expertise areas
- Uses CPV code similarity

**⚔️ Competition Level (15 points):**
- Fewer expected bidders = higher score
- Country-specific competition data

**⏰ Deadline Pressure (10 points):**
- More time for preparation = higher score
- Penalizes urgent deadlines

### **3. Winning Strategies**
For each tender, clients get:
- **Success Probability**: Based on their profile
- **Competition Analysis**: Expected number of bidders
