I sent you an email a few days ago about the {prospect.lost_tender_title} contract you recently bid on.

I wanted to follow up because I just found 2 new {prospect.sector} opportunities in {prospect.country} that close next week:

1. {prospect.country} Government: Digital Services Contract
   üí∞ Value: ‚Ç¨{prospect.lost_tender_value}
   ‚è∞ Deadline: 3 days
   
2. {prospect.buyer_name}: IT Infrastructure Upgrade  
   üí∞ Value: ‚Ç¨650,000
   ‚è∞ Deadline: 5 days

These are exactly the type of contracts that companies like {prospect.company_name} win with TenderPulse.

Our users typically see 3-5x more relevant opportunities because we monitor ALL procurement portals, not just the obvious ones.

Quick question: Are you currently tracking opportunities across multiple EU procurement systems, or just the main ones?

If you're missing opportunities (which most companies are), I can show you exactly what you're missing in a 5-minute demo.

Just reply "DEMO" and I'll send you a calendar link.

Best,
Alex
TenderPulse

P.S. - The average {prospect.sector} company misses 60% of relevant contracts because they're not monitoring all the right places. Don't let that be you.

This is my final email about the {prospect.sector} opportunities I found for {prospect.company_name}.

I understand you're busy, but I wanted to make sure you don't miss these:

üî• URGENT - Closing in 2 days:
‚Ä¢ {prospect.country} Digital Transformation Contract
‚Ä¢ Value: ‚Ç¨{prospect.lost_tender_value}
‚Ä¢ Similar to the {prospect.lost_tender_title} you recently bid on

üî• Closing in 4 days:
‚Ä¢ {prospect.buyer_name} IT Services Contract
‚Ä¢ Value: ‚Ç¨720,000
‚Ä¢ Perfect fit for your expertise

Here's the thing - I've been helping {prospect.sector} companies in {prospect.country} win more contracts for 3 years.

The companies that win consistently are the ones that:
‚úì See opportunities early (weeks, not days)
‚úì Focus on contracts they can actually win
‚úì Have templates ready for common requirements

TenderPulse gives you all three.

I'm not going to email you again after this, but if you want to see what opportunities you're missing right now, just reply "YES" and I'll send you a free trial.

No strings attached. Just 5 minutes to see what you're missing.

Best,
Alex
TenderPulse

P.S. - The next big {prospect.sector} contract in {prospect.country} could be published tomorrow. Will you see it?
